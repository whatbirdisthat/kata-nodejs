NodeJS Bowling Kata

Javascripty bowling kata thing.

I also made a bit of a unit test frameworky
thing as I was going along.

Showing a few different language features,
but hoping to not use too many.

I think the interesting part is the 
total lack of "frameworks".

What? So how do you do your unit tests?

Run with `docker-compose run bowling`

:)
